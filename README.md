# DiscordBot
The Slurm Factory is a Discord bot that I created to practice using the Discord.py api and better familiarize myself with python. The name is a reference to my favorite Futurama episode, which is where I pulled my gaming tag "slurms" from. This bot serves as a basic react for roles bot as well as providing some fun chat commands for some copypastas. I had a lot of fun making this bot and I hope everyone has fun using it as well. If you would like to use it for yourself, you may either message me on Discord at slurms#0420 since Discord does not allow direct invite links for bots in under 100 servers, or just fork and clone this repo and use my code as a springboard for your own bot! 

### Using the bot

The main purpose of this bot is to complete some basic chat commands, as well as set roles based on reactions to messages.  This will allow users to react to a pinned message in a channel in order to get roles to allow them to access other channels in the server.  For the chat commands, there are a few built in currently.  Simply type ahhh, holdon, or hello, preceded by $.  the $ is the symbol the bot listens for so it won't trigger if you just type hello.  I plan on expanding these commands further in the future.

### Bot Hosting

Currently the live version of the bot is hosted using replit, as it is the simplest way to host single server bots.  If I were to grow this bot into a larger project, I would definitely move it onto a stronger hosting service like Vultr, but for now, replit is working wonderfully.

### Challenges

I definitely ran into quite a few challenges while working on this bot.  Discord.py is no longer a supported development tool for Discord, as theyve normalized their bot development to be predominately based in JavaScript.  I, however, wanted practice with Python as I hadn't used it much before this project.  That being said, the api doesn't work in any version of python3 post 2021, or pre 3.8, so I found that the best way to work with it was using replit for the majority of the development process.  All in all these challenges definitely pushed me outside of my comfort zone and made me think on my toes so I'm very glad I followed through with it.
